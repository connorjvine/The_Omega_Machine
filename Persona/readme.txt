THE OMEGA MACHINE

This project was created for Interactive Spaces for the Persona assignment

The project is an audio-based interactive experience where the player chooses what the character says in response to the antagonist.

The outcome, or ending, is based on which choices the player makes.

There are 4 endings in total.

All voices were acted and recorded by me using SONAR X3 Professional.

This has been tested on Firefox, Chrome did not seem to like loading .mp3's using the file protocol, but once published as a website it should function fine on all browsers.

Reccomended that you play with headphones, as it is an audio-based experience.

Have Fun!
